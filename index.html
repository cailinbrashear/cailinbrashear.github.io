        <h3> Original:</h3> 
        <p>Hi! My name is Cailin Brashear, and I’m a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying public professional writing and communications with a minor in international relations. I currently hold an internship as a public relations representative at an international film streaming website called Filmatique – which allows me to bring my interests in art, cinema, social issues, and world travel to life! For the short duration of my adult life thusfar, I have spent a great deal of time traveling the world and pursuing my deep interests in fields such as literature, art, food, music and writing. In my free time, when I’m not studying, working as a sever at a local restaurant, or engaged in a multitude of tasks for my internship and clubs I am involved with, I like to cook, surround myself with family and friends, read, write, go hiking and engage in meaningful conversations about life and society!</p>

        <p> Hi! My name is Cailin Brashear, and I’m a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Public Professional Writing and Communications with a minor in International Political Science. I currently hold an internship as a public relations intern at an international film streaming website called Filmatique – which allows me to bring my interests in art, cinema, social issues, and world culture to life! For the short duration of my adult life thus far, I have enjoyed spending my time traveling the world and pursuing my deep interests in fields such as literature, art, food, music and writing. I enjoy the humanities and feel passionately about many current social issues which I feel affects everyone’s lives. As a student, my studies take up a great majority of my time. But, when I’m not hitting the books, I enjoy cooking, listening to music, hiking, and surrounding myself with family and friends! I also hold a second part-time job as a server at Shady Grove and am actively involved in Panther Relations – a student run PR firm on campus, and Sigma Sigma Sigma! In my life I hope to be able to put my energy into many places, people, and every experience that I strive to have and make the most of. </p>
