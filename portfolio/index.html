        <h3>Soundscapes 1 and 2</h3>

        </audio>
        <p>A rain begins, followed by a storm. A variety of birds are attempting to take shelter as the listener makes his/her way inside. She/he opens a creaky cabin door, shuts it, and maker his/her way over to the fireplace. She/her then lights a match and begins to make a fire. Soon she/her finds that a small bee has taken shelter inside. The clip ends with the listener swatting the buzzing bee as if It were the end of the song Grantchester Meadows by Pink Floyd. When I thought of soundscape, a lot of introductions to instrumental songs, like this one, were brought to my mind. I have always loved how musicians can recreate locations and actions purely through sound in order to evoke an emotional reaction. I took this into consideration and allowed these songs to inspire me when creating my soundscape.</p>
        <h3>An example of a choice related to genre or audience</h3>
        <img src="../../static/images/genrebefore.jpg" width="500" height="auto">  <img src="../../static/images/genre.png" width="500" height="auto">
        <p>I photoshopped this picture of Jack Nicholson from The Shining to make it fit under the documentary genre. If I had to reimagine this work in another genre, I would chose to have it fit under a science fiction genre and perhaps add a dystopian background and change the colors to more metallic cools. I would also change something about his overall appearance – whether that be his hair, eyes, etc. – as a way to make him look slightly more than human. If I made this change, I believe that my audience would have a curious reaction to it, much like many do for science fiction photos and advertisements. For an expert on my topic, I would be able to make more subtle hints. Whereas, for someone who knew little about movie advertisements and/or science fiction, I would have to make the advertisement more obviously dystopian – adding exact, futuristic elements into my background (i.e. new age technologies).</p>
        <h3>An example of a choice I made related to color, fonts, captions or scale</h3>
        <img src="../../static/images/originallogo (2).png" id="Ad-img">  <img src="../../static/images/logo (2).png" id="Ad-img">
        <p>My logo activity ended up being a design that I revised the most – going in a completely different direction based off a different design and content choice. Originally, I planned on making a logo for a restaurant that I could see myself having in the future. My first design lacked a lot of what I wanted the restaurant to contain. While I originally wanted a grungy vibe, I decided to go a more laid-back route that would better express the real values of the restaurant as a whole. I want the restaurant to be sustainable and focus on “green eatings”. I felt that the cool colors of light green and blue really emphasized this aspect of the restaurant, while the simplistic plant on a plate design mirrored the element of sustainability. While I realize that the name of the restaurant could be confusing to some, I designed it with a strategic font and color coordination that would mimic both words “green” and “eatings” to make a new spelling of the work “greetings” and also contain the word “great”. Under different circumstances, I would probably resort back to my first image if I decided that my restaurant would be better suited as a grungy, rock-centric establishment in order to better suit the vibe.</p>

        <h4>Original About Me:</h4>
        <p>Hi! My name is Cailin Brashear, and I’m a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Public Professional Writing and Communications with a minor in International Political Science. I currently hold an internship as a public relations intern at an international film streaming website called Filmatique – which allows me to bring my interests in art, cinema, social issues, and world culture to life! For the short duration of my adult life thus far, I have enjoyed spending my time traveling the world and pursuing my deep interests in fields such as literature, art, food, music and writing. I enjoy the humanities and feel passionately about many current social issues which I feel affects everyone’s lives. As a student, my studies take up a great majority of my time. But, when I’m not hitting the books, I enjoy cooking, listening to music, hiking, and surrounding myself with family and friends! I also hold a second part-time job as a server at Shady Grove and am actively involved in Panther Relations – a student run PR firm on campus, and Sigma Sigma Sigma! In my life I hope to be able to put my energy into many places, people, and every experience that I strive to have and make the most of.</p>
        <h4>Revised About Me:</h4>
        <p>My name is Cailin Brashear, and I am an upcoming senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in both Communication and Public Professional Writing with a minor in Political Science. Outside of the classroom, my personal interests lie primarily in the arts, which has been reflected in some of my previous work experience with Filmatique, a boutique, art-house film streaming company. 
I have always considered my love for the arts to be embedded into who I am and who I want to be. I admire music, art, cinema and literature and hold a continuous thirst for learning and consuming as much of it as I can. In fact, some of my most rewarding work with the arts was when I found myself as an undergraduate teacher’s assistant for Introduction to Modern Art here at the University of Pittsburgh during my sophomore year. I find a great deal of value in working with my hands – everything from painting and sketching to cooking and dabbling in mechanic work. 
More recently, I have become enamored with outdoor activities like gardening and hiking as I try to become more acquainted with the world around me. This has translated directly into my traveling experiences which I value as some of the more empowering moments of my life. As my Political Science minor infers, I like to keep up to date with the current political climate and find it important to develop fact-based opinions on societal and political issues. </p>

        <h3>An example of something that I'm particularly proud of</h3>
        <img src="../../static/images/Ad.jpg" id="Ad-img">  <img src="../../static/images/sample 1 .png" id="Ad2-img">
        <p>For my first photoshop project, I was particularly proud of how this came out. While it may still be a little rough around the edges, I was very pleased with the way the wording came out and the fact that, at first glance, the image headings look almost indiscernible from each other. I believe I really accomplished the satirical parody of this vintage piece that I was going for when analyzing it under a feminist lens. I also feel that the style of the piece fits well into the overall style and composition of my site - which is a nice bonus! Overall, I am very proud of the revisions I made to this piece and hope to continue working with photoshop to better my skills on altering words and phrases.</p>
