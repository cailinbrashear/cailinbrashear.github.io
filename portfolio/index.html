        <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3> 
        <p>I define revision as a second chance. I see it as just another step in the larger project, an imperative detail of the bigger picture. Books are not written, they are rewritten, and then rewritten a few more times after that. As a writing major, I have done a lot of revising in my days, but I had little to no experience in revising digital media until enrolling in this course. I now understand revising on a much different level – not only revising my words and my thoughts, but completely revisioning ideas so that they can become completely new entities. Whether it be in passages, websites, images, or audio clips, I have learned that even the smallest revisions can make a huge difference towards your overall goal, values, expectations, contexts, and audiences. </p>
        <p>Before I entered this class, I had absolutely no experience using HTML or CSS. The most experience I had with digital media and web design was crafting a few Wordpress sites or messing around with photoshop when I got the chance. Honestly, I would have called myself the exact opposite of tech-savvy. Now, while I know that some areas still need to be drastically improved, I feel much more comfortable navigating myself through these medias as well as have a better understanding to what different uses mean in different contexts and to different audiences. </p>
        <p>As for my website, I feel that it matched the original goal of a classic, yet grungy vibe that is fit for both my peers as well as for those in my future career path. The work in my portfolio was highly impacted by these goals and concepts in some areas, while in others the targets do not show through as vividly. For example, my photoshop expectations assignment, soundscape, Audacity Tutorial 2, logo project, and About Me all seem very cohesive – matching the overall design concept and target audience that I was leaning towards. These assignments all show the more unapologetically political nature of a college student that prides herself in commenting against social norms and ideas. My photoshop expectations assignment is a parody through a feminist lens, my logo assignment is based for a sustainable restaurant, and my audacity 2 tutorial is a narration from one of my favorite anti-establishment philosophers, Alan Watts. Overall, I feel that these projects, as well as the overall design concept of my site, will be inciteful to my audience in discovering my own personal values. I expect them to react positively and with an open mind as my site is very interactive and accessible to all.</p>
        <p>In What Are Multimodal Projects, the authors address that “to produce a successful text, writers must be able to consciously use different modes both alone and in combination with each other to communicate their ideas to others.” I believe that this quote sums up the process of creating my assignments as well as my site better than anything else. Not only has my writing played a large key in my reflection process, but the text that I have provided in my graphic assignments is probably one of their main components and was chosen with specific purposes in mind. For example, my photoshop expectations assignment relies heavily on the text that is incorporated. In fact, the text is the main revision that I made to the original photograph. Besides just text, the “multimodal” factors of my assignments have all been very key to my design concept as a whole. My soundscape, for example, is an indirect expression of a much broader idea – telling an entire story in 60 seconds using sound as my audience’s only active sense. Other projects, such as my storyboard and my audacity 2 assignment utilize narration with either text or images to create such a structure. These are some of the most important aspects of my writing assignments this semester – the multimodal features and characteristics that make each work accessible to many different parties. </p>
        <p>Peer review has played a minimal role in my development over the course of this semester as I feel that my work was not workshopped in many ways due to the extraneous circumstances. With this being said, I feel that being able to see others’ work and compare it to my own was a great way to begin approaching my editing and revision process. My editing strategies differed from project to project, with some being minor edits and others being entirely new versions. Editing my storyboard, for example, was a very cohesive process where I continued to work where I left off. Other projects, such as my logo activity and Yelp Review, I started completely from scratch as I was not happy with my original work. These processes were tedious and time consuming, but I was able to learn from each one and able to better understand how I wanted each assignment to play into the overall structure and meaning of my site. </p>
        <h3>Soundscapes 1 and 2</h3>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="../../static/images/Soundscape.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>
        <p>A rain begins, followed by a storm. A variety of birds are attempting to take shelter as the listener makes his/her way inside. She/he opens a creaky cabin door, shuts it, and maker his/her way over to the fireplace. She/her then lights a match and begins to make a fire. Soon she/her finds that a small bee has taken shelter inside. The clip ends with the listener swatting the buzzing bee as if It were the end of the song Grantchester Meadows by Pink Floyd. When I thought of soundscape, a lot of introductions to instrumental songs, like this one, were brought to my mind. I have always loved how musicians can recreate locations and actions purely through sound in order to evoke an emotional reaction. I took this into consideration and allowed these songs to inspire me when creating my soundscape.</p>
        <h3>An example of a choice related to genre or audience</h3>
        <img src="../../static/images/genrebefore.jpg" width="500" height="auto">  <img src="../../static/images/genre.png" width="500" height="auto">
        <p>I photoshopped this picture of Jack Nicholson from The Shining to make it fit under the documentary genre. If I had to reimagine this work in another genre, I would chose to have it fit under a science fiction genre and perhaps add a dystopian background and change the colors to more metallic cools. I would also change something about his overall appearance – whether that be his hair, eyes, etc. – as a way to make him look slightly more than human. If I made this change, I believe that my audience would have a curious reaction to it, much like many do for science fiction photos and advertisements. For an expert on my topic, I would be able to make more subtle hints. Whereas, for someone who knew little about movie advertisements and/or science fiction, I would have to make the advertisement more obviously dystopian – adding exact, futuristic elements into my background (i.e. new age technologies).</p>
        <h3>An example of a choice I made related to color, fonts, captions or scale</h3>
        <img src="../../static/images/originallogo (2).png" id="Ad-img">  <img src="../../static/images/logo (2).png" id="Ad-img">
        <p>My logo activity ended up being a design that I revised the most – going in a completely different direction based off a different design and content choice. Originally, I planned on making a logo for a restaurant that I could see myself having in the future. My first design lacked a lot of what I wanted the restaurant to contain. While I originally wanted a grungy vibe, I decided to go a more laid-back route that would better express the real values of the restaurant as a whole. I want the restaurant to be sustainable and focus on “green eatings”. I felt that the cool colors of light green and blue really emphasized this aspect of the restaurant, while the simplistic plant on a plate design mirrored the element of sustainability. While I realize that the name of the restaurant could be confusing to some, I designed it with a strategic font and color coordination that would mimic both words “green” and “eatings” to make a new spelling of the work “greetings” and also contain the word “great”. Under different circumstances, I would probably resort back to my first image if I decided that my restaurant would be better suited as a grungy, rock-centric establishment in order to better suit the vibe.</p>

        <h4>Original About Me:</h4>
        <p>Hi! My name is Cailin Brashear, and I’m a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Public Professional Writing and Communications with a minor in International Political Science. I currently hold an internship as a public relations intern at an international film streaming website called Filmatique – which allows me to bring my interests in art, cinema, social issues, and world culture to life! For the short duration of my adult life thus far, I have enjoyed spending my time traveling the world and pursuing my deep interests in fields such as literature, art, food, music and writing. I enjoy the humanities and feel passionately about many current social issues which I feel affects everyone’s lives. As a student, my studies take up a great majority of my time. But, when I’m not hitting the books, I enjoy cooking, listening to music, hiking, and surrounding myself with family and friends! I also hold a second part-time job as a server at Shady Grove and am actively involved in Panther Relations – a student run PR firm on campus, and Sigma Sigma Sigma! In my life I hope to be able to put my energy into many places, people, and every experience that I strive to have and make the most of.</p>
        <h4>Revised About Me:</h4>
        <p>My name is Cailin Brashear, and I am an upcoming senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in both Communication and Public Professional Writing with a minor in Political Science. Outside of the classroom, my personal interests lie primarily in the arts, which has been reflected in some of my previous work experience with Filmatique, a boutique, art-house film streaming company. 
I have always considered my love for the arts to be embedded into who I am and who I want to be. I admire music, art, cinema and literature and hold a continuous thirst for learning and consuming as much of it as I can. In fact, some of my most rewarding work with the arts was when I found myself as an undergraduate teacher’s assistant for Introduction to Modern Art here at the University of Pittsburgh during my sophomore year. I find a great deal of value in working with my hands – everything from painting and sketching to cooking and dabbling in mechanic work. 
More recently, I have become enamored with outdoor activities like gardening and hiking as I try to become more acquainted with the world around me. This has translated directly into my traveling experiences which I value as some of the more empowering moments of my life. As my Political Science minor infers, I like to keep up to date with the current political climate and find it important to develop fact-based opinions on societal and political issues. </p>

        <h3>An example of something that frustrated me</h3>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="../../static/images/audacity 4.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>
        <p>Audacity in and of itself frustrated me a bit. I don’t know whether it was my computer sound system or a problem with the application on my laptop itself, but it was not working very well for me and caused a lot of hiccups in my assignments. I decided that, of all my audacity tutorials, the one that frustrated me the most was the looping assignment – partially because I had expected it to be the easiest. It was hard for me to locate a correct sound, and when I did, nothing seemed to sound like a consistent loop. Perhaps it was the sound clip I chose or confusion about the tutorial itself, but my loop remains sounding a little halfhearted. The worst part is that the more I seemed to cut and revise, the more I seemed to mess it up. I decided to give my best effort and move on from this small project so that I would be able to focus my time on ones that peaked my interest more, like the narration assignment and the soundscape that didn’t give me as many issues. </p>
        <h3>An example of something that I'm particularly proud of</h3>
        <img src="../../static/images/Ad.jpg" id="Ad-img">  <img src="../../static/images/sample 1 .png" id="Ad2-img">
        <p>For my first photoshop project, I was particularly proud of how this came out. While it may still be a little rough around the edges, I was very pleased with the way the wording came out and the fact that, at first glance, the image headings look almost indiscernible from each other. I believe I really accomplished the satirical parody of this vintage piece that I was going for when analyzing it under a feminist lens. I also feel that the style of the piece fits well into the overall style and composition of my site - which is a nice bonus! Overall, I am very proud of the revisions I made to this piece and hope to continue working with photoshop to better my skills on altering words and phrases.</p>
