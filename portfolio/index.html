        <p>For my first photoshop project, I was particularly proud of how this came out. While it may still be a little rough around the edges, I was very pleased with the way the wording came out and the fact that, at first glance, the image headings look almost indiscernible from each other. I believe I really accomplished the satirical parody of this vintage piece that I was going for when analyzing it under a feminist lens. I also feel that the style of the piece fits well into the overall style and composition of my site - which is a nice bonus! Overall, I am very proud of the revisions I made to this piece and hope to continue working with photoshop to better my skills on altering words and phrases.</p>
