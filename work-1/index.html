    <p>I have had my fair share of struggles while conducting these projects to say the least. Upon entering this class, I had zero experience with HTML or CSS, and, as someone who finds herself struggling to create simple WordPress pages, I was nervous. Now, with many hours of constantly refreshing and scanning my screen to see why on earth a change happened that I did not anticipate to, I can say that I am beginning to learn a lot about HTML and CSS as a whole. The satisfaction of typing in small words, phrases, and numbers and having it change before your eyes into real visual effects is comparable to fixing the headlight on your car – real work that elicits a visible effect. I do have to say, the feelings of accomplishment that follow doing something right is well worth the struggle. This is a skill that I never expected to have, and, even with the small amount of knowledge I have learned thus far, I feel as if I am developing hard skills that will benefit me in the future. And that’s the reason I took this class in the first place. </p>
 <p2> Most of my original works needed a good deal of up-keep to add to my website. First, I updated my about me – adding subjects and a voice that I would want to exemplify me better to my audience as well as thoroughly expanding what I wanted my website to portray. I still feel as if this section will need some work, but I feel as if I need to start adding real content before finalizing this section. 
	I completely revised my embedded fiction assignment. I first began with a yelp review, and then changed it to an AirBnb review with basically the same premise, but that I feel relates better to the topic of imbedded fiction and is more relevant in my own life. 
	Finally, I revised my envisioning my design draft by creating more clear, concrete ideas and scratching abstract, vague topics in order to get a better feel for what I really wanted my website to be. I changed my theme slightly, narrowed it a bit and made it less rough around the edges so that it would result in a more cohesive and coherent vision to my audience. </p2>
	  <p3>I used many strategies, most through trial and error, to integrate and practice web design principles through crafting my website. First off, I began slowly with picking and changing several fonts to decide which ones I liked back, what size, and in what location on the page. I liked how the CSS only involves one, single index so that I did not have to be switching back and forth between pages to make specific changes. Crafting my main menu is what I believe to be my biggest achievement in regards to using CSS – linking every menu item into one group and changing the formatting from there. I really liked how it turned out. I also made my website very centralized with hopes that my audience’s eye will easily follow down the page with the flow of information. I did not originally intend to do this, but, after trying many different alignment options, I felt that it looked best this way. Choosing the background color was also something that I did not plan on, as I originally wanted to incorporate a good deal of white space, but adding a beige color made the site itself feel more put together, warmer, and less harsh and contrasted. </p3>
    <p4> For me, one of my biggest struggles was aligning my menu’s and texts the way I wanted them to be and finding just the right balance of indentations and margins that looked right on screen. I realized that, most of the time, how I wanted it to look originally did not end up being the best suited design strategy for the page; I had to allow for changes as such. 
	Though I do believe I have come along way, I know that I have many things left to learn. I would like to learn how to possibly add animations and moving items on my webpage when the audience scrolls down or pans over certain objects. I attempted to read about the subject, but it was way over my frame of current knowledge. I also hope to learn more about photo and image photoshop so that I may fill my website with many various images that seem coherent to the theme of the webpage itself. Finally, I would like to learn graphic design skills that would allow me to envision a true logo for my website – as I believe this would be a good hard-skill to have in my life and would benefit my professional career later on. </p4>
