Yelp Review: Pittsburgh Zoo
by Cailin Brashear 
Let me begin first with saying that this establishment was an abomination. I recently took my 
kids here for a weekend getaway in hopes of seeing some real wildlife as we are native 
Pittsburghers and recently realized that we have never traveled to the zoo 
ourselves. This place 
was filthy! There was fecil matter in the cages! With the animals! Animals producing fecil
matter?? In front of unknowing onlookers such as my children and me 
–
how dare they?! On 
top of it all, I could not even find one single animal
for purchase. My daughter cried and cried 
because all she came there for was to get a penguin for Christmas. Is that too much to ask? I 
had $20 hot and ready to spend in my pocket and yet I left with nothing but a lousy stuffed 
animal of a 
unicorn. I didn
’t even see any unicorns there! What kind of zoo doesn’t have 
unicorns? Also, I felt extremely unsafe and on edge the entire duration of the trip. No animals 
were in muzzles or on leashes?? What’s up with that? You think that a 6 inch glass wall is 
enough 
to hold an 87 pound fox away from my children? Guess again. We will not be returning 
to this establishment in the near future, and I beg that anyone considering this place as a fun 
vacation for family please reconsider.</p>
