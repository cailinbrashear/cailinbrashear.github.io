    <h3>Orginal:</h3> 
    <p>For my website, I plan to engage my audience in many aspects of my life –both professionally and creatively. My audience, in hopes, will include friends and peers as well as future colleges or people I hope to engage with on a professional level. The purpose will be to showcase what I believe to be the most important things in my life in a blog of sorts. I would like to display an easy-to-navigate site with categories across the top consisting of travel, studies, the arts, sustainabilitypractices, life philosophies, friendsetc. One website that I frequently visit is called Filmatique –a site that I personally work for –and I would like to incorporate their simplistic style, easy navigation, and memorable title pages and headings into my site. Visually speaking, I would like to showcase an artistic, yet semi-simplistic theme as to not clutter my website. I would like to use colors and fonts that I feel exemplify my own personality and life experiences –earthy, yet bold; classic with a grungy twist. I want to use a classic, cursive font for headings and an easily legible, classic font for text such as Garamond. Colors should include blacks and greys, reds, and a good deal of white space while also incorporating earthy accent tones of yellows, greens and purples where I see fit. Ideally, each category should have a different feel to it that mirrors the topics within but still follow an overarching theme. My life itself and the categories I will showcase are very different, so I would like to prescribe a different feel for each one to better relate to my audience as a whole and to develop what I believe to be an interesting and aesthetically pleasing portrayal of myself.</p>
    <h3>Revised:</h3>
    <p2> For my website, I plan to engage my audience in many aspects of my life – both professionally and creatively. I am aiming for my audience to be friends and peers as well as, hopefully, people whom I plan to engage with on a more professional level as a way to demonstrate my personality as well as my digital media skills. The purpose will be to showcase what I believe to be the most important aspects of my life in a type of on-going blog. The final draft should include main-menu categories such as traveling, studies, work, the arts, personal goals, life philosophies, etc. One website that I frequently visit and work for is called Filmatique – a simplistic and elegant film streaming website that does an amazing job at mirroring the content they display through the design that they have produced. I would like to, not exactly imitate their concepts, but imitate the idea of using the design work not to overshadow the content but rather to implement designs that compliment the content. 
Visually speaking, I would like to implement a classic design with a grungy twist. Heroin chic, like a dirty martini or a scotch and soda – subtle, classic, with that “don’t mess with me vibe”. I want to use colors that are bold, yet still muted. Beige and red like Louboutin heels, with dark greys and black fonts that don’t scream like they are trying too hard to stand out or be read. As for fonts, I would like to use a scratchy, almost journal like cursive for my heading accompanied by a simple, classic font like Garamond or times new roman for my content as to not take away from its legibility. Ideally, each category should have a slightly different take that mirrors the content it is portraying but still follows this overarching theme of a warm heroin chic. . My life itself and the categories I will showcase are very different, so I would like to prescribe a different feel for each one to better relate to my audience as a whole and to develop what I believe to be an interesting and aesthetically pleasing portrayal of myself. For example, when I discuss travels, I would like to use earthy tones; when I discuss music and art, I would like to up the grunge feel; when I discuss personal goals and aspirations, perhaps lighter and cheerier. All in all, I want it to display a sense of freedom and contradiction. </p2>
