    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>My second work in progress moved a lot quicker than my first to say the least. Continuously learning how to navigate through HTML and CSS has provided me with many hard skills in digital media that I definitely lacked prior to this class. With each passing assignment, I have found that several forms of digital media have been becoming easier and easier for me to use (as a previously technologically inept individual) </p>
    <p>As for my classroom photoshop assignments, I really enjoyed them! Using photoshop has always been a skill I had hoped to possess, and, though these pieces, I am so much more confident using photoshop as a whole. In the past, layering and making additions to photographs had always been an issue for me. Now, I feel as though I fully understand the concept and can use it to my advantage. For example, in my expectations piece, I was able to fully remove and rearrange all letters using layers and regroup them into my final photo. Also, for my storyboard, I learned how to add other photographs and text to a template. These are improvements to my past knowledge of simple filter and color edits. Another hard skill I really enjoyed learning was logo making! I believe that I will find use of all of these skills later on in my career path, so I am glad that I am becoming more and more confident when using these programs. </p>
    <p>Some of my projects that I am most proud of are my expectations and logo pieces. I really enjoyed creating my expectations piece as I felt that it fit well into the overall design of my website as well as embodies who I am. It is both satirical and political and a great example of what photoshop can do! It took a lot of time and attention to detail, but I am overall proud of the finished product. As for my logo design, I really like the play on words of ‘greetings’, ‘green’, ‘eatings’, and ‘great’. One of my goals in life is to open up a sustainable restaurant and this is exactly how I imagined my logo for this hypothetical website to turn out – everything from the color scheme, to the images, to the wording! Overall, I’m really happy with all of my classwork samples. </p>  
    <p4>As for revisions and additions to my site, once I was able to figure out how to add images, it was all smooth sailing from there! Adding the images was a little troubling for me at first, but once I figured out how to add my profile picture, adding the rest of my photoshop images for my classwork samples was a breeze! Then I enjoyed editing the photos to be the size and shape I wanted through CSS. </p4>  
    <p5>Upon starting my work in progress, my website was far from perfect. I really liked my overall design, such as the fonts and colors, but it needed touching up. First, I went through all of my pages and changed the name of some menu items – taking our hyphens and unnecessary wording. Then, I changed my submenus by making them more centralized like the top menu and taking out those pesky bullet points that just would not leave before! I also decided to change my about me section and add a third revision which I thought better exemplified me and the purpose of this site. </p5>  
    <p6>Integrating web design principles has also become more and more easy with every passing day working on this site. I had learned to design my site in a way to make it easy on the eyes as well as easy on the mousepad! I really enjoy how centralized my website is and how the eyes of my audience are instantly directed exactly where I want them to be! Creating a working CSS is one of the most important parts of creating a website, and I feel as if I am well on my way to accomplishing this in full! </p6>
    <p7>Overall, I have been moving swiftly through my progress in this class and am proud of my past accomplishments as well as excited for the upcoming. I feel my skills increasing and my confidence with digital media growing as well. In the future, I plan to see even further development to my website and be able to touch up some pieces that are still rough around the edges. Most importantly, I am having a good time expressing myself through these digital mediums and am looking forward to furthering my knowledge about them as well as my aptitude while using them in the future. </p7>
