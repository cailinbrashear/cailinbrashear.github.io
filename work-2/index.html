    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p1>My second work in progress moved a lot quicker than my first to say the least. Continuously learning how to navigate through HTML and CSS has provided me with many hard skills in digital media that I definitely lacked prior to this class. With each passing assignment, I have found that several forms of digital media have been becoming easier and easier for me to use (as a previously technologically inept individual) </p1>
    <p2>As for my classroom photoshop assignments, I really enjoyed them! Using photoshop has always been a skill I had hoped to possess, and, though these pieces, I am so much more confident using photoshop as a whole. In the past, layering and making additions to photographs had always been an issue for me. Now, I feel as though I fully understand the concept and can use it to my advantage. For example, in my expectations piece, I was able to fully remove and rearrange all letters using layers and regroup them into my final photo. Also, for my storyboard, I learned how to add other photographs and text to a template. These are improvements to my past knowledge of simple filter and color edits. Another hard skill I really enjoyed learning was logo making! I believe that I will find use of all of these skills later on in my career path, so I am glad that I am becoming more and more confident when using these programs. </p2>
